**2025, November:** With Hamdi Joudeh, we are organizing the [2025 van der Meulen Seminar](https://www.tue-ictlab.nl/page/10) at TU Eindhoven on Monday, 24 November. The theme is Shannon theory. The registration is free. 

**2025, September:** ICT Lab will present 4 papers at [ECOC 2025](https://ecoc2025.org/): W.01.04.2, W.01.05.4, W.02.01.56, and W.02.01.75. Our paper "[Lowering Error Floors for Hard Decision Decoding of OFEC Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12155)" (W.01.04.2) is a part of the project [BIT-FREE](https://research.tue.nl/en/projects/hybrid-coded-modulation-for-reliable-and-power-efficient-coherent) funded by NWO via the Open Technology Programme. Our paper "[A New 5-bit/2D-symbol Modulation Format for Relative Intensity Noise-dominated IM-DD Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01761)" (W.02.01.56) is a result of our collaboration with Marvell Technology (USA).

**2025, July:** Our paper "[On Error Rate Approximations for FSO Systems with Weak Turbulence and Pointing Errors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11083585)" ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19627)) is published in the IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics. This work is a part of the project [BIT-FREE](https://research.tue.nl/en/projects/hybrid-coded-modulation-for-reliable-and-power-efficient-coherent) funded by NWO via the Open Technology Programme.

**2025, April:** ICT Lab had a strong presence at OFC 2025 with 6 papers: Tu2F.6, W1K.1, W1K.2, W1K.5, W4H.2, and Th1K.8. Our paper "[On Geometric Shaping for 400 Gbps IM-DD Links with Laser Intensity Noise](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11046783)" (Th1K.8, [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17433)) is a result of our collaboration with Marvell Technology (USA).

**2025, March:** I visited Communications Engineering Lab (CEL) for three weeks as part of the KIT International Excellence Fellowship programme. Our paper [On the Design and Performance of Machine Learning Based Error Correcting Decoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15899) was also presented at [SCC 2025](https://scc2025.net/) organised by KIT in Karlsruhe, Germany.

**2025, January:** I received an [NWO](https://www.nwo.nl/en) (Dutch Research Council) [NGF AINed XS grant](https://www.nwo.nl/en/news/last-ten-research-projects-launched-for-ngf-ained-europa-xs). The project (AI-SUSAT) will cover the application of AI to underwater satellite communications in collaboration with The Centre Tecnològic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), located in Barcelona, Spain.

**2024, July:** We organized [2024 IEEE European School of Information Theory](http://www.tue-ictlab.nl/page/3) in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.

**2024, April:** I gave an invited talk at the [Munich Workshop on Shannon Coding Techniques](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/lnt/events/2024-munich-workshops-on-coding/2024-munich-workshop-on-shannon-coding-techniques-msct/).

**2024, March:** I visited Communications Engineering Lab (CEL) for three weeks as part of the KIT International Excellence Fellowship programme.
