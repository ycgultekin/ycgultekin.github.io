**2025, July:** Our paper ``[On Error Rate Approximations for FSO Systems with Weak Turbulence and Pointing Errors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11083585)'' is published in the IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19627)). This work is a part of the project [BIT-FREE](https://research.tue.nl/en/projects/hybrid-coded-modulation-for-reliable-and-power-efficient-coherent) by NWO via the Open Technology Programme.

**2025, April:** ICT Lab had a strong presence at OFC 2025 with 6 papers: Tu2F.6, W1K.1, W1K.2, W1K.5, W4H.2, and Th1K.8. Our paper ``On Geometric Shaping for 400 Gbps IM-DD Links with Laser Intensity Noise'' (Th1K.8) is a result of our collaboration with Marvell Technology (USA).

**2025, March:** I visited Communications Engineering Lab (CEL) for three weeks as part of the KIT International Excellence Fellowship programme. Our paper [On the Design and Performance of Machine Learning Based Error Correcting Decoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15899) was also presented at [SCC 2025](https://scc2025.net/) organised by KIT in Karlsruhe, Germany.

**2025, January:** I received an [NWO](https://www.nwo.nl/en) (Dutch Research Council) [NGF AINed XS grant](https://www.nwo.nl/en/news/last-ten-research-projects-launched-for-ngf-ained-europa-xs). The project (AI-SUSAT) will cover the application of AI to underwater satellite communications in collaboration with The Centre Tecnol√≤gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), located in Barcelona, Spain.

**2024, July:** We organized [2024 IEEE European School of Information Theory](http://www.tue-ictlab.nl/page/3) in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.

**2024, April:** I gave an invited talk at the [Munich Workshop on Shannon Coding Techniques](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/lnt/events/2024-munich-workshops-on-coding/2024-munich-workshop-on-shannon-coding-techniques-msct/).

**2024, March:** I visited Communications Engineering Lab (CEL) for three weeks as part of the KIT International Excellence Fellowship programme.
