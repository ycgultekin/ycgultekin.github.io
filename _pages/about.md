I'm a senior researcher (equivalent to Assistant Professor) in the [Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)](https://www.tue.nl/en/), the Netherlands. I am a member of the [Information and Communication Theory (ICT) Lab](https://www.tue-ictlab.nl/).

I received the B.Sc. and the M.Sc. degrees from the [Middle East Technical University](https://www.metu.edu.tr/), Ankara, Turkey, both in electrical and electronics engineering, in 2013 and 2015, respectively. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in 2020 from TU/e. From 2020 to 2023, I was a postdoc researcher at the ICT Lab. Since 2024, I am a senior researcher. Since January 2023, I also do part-time freelance work via [IC2H Consulting](https://www.ic2h.nl/).

My research has received multiple awards, including Best Paper awards at the 2018 WIC/IEEE Symposium on Information Theory and Signal Processing in the Benelux and at the 2022 Optica Advanced Photonics Congress, a 2023 Quantum Delta NL [exchange visit](https://quantumdelta.nl/news/qdnl-visitor-s-programme-update-yunus-can-gueltekin-and-fenglei-gu) grant, and a 2024 International Excellence Fellowship from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). My technical expertise and research interests lie in the intersection of information theory and communication theory, with a particular focus on the design of coded modulation and constellation shaping techniques for wireless/optical communications.
